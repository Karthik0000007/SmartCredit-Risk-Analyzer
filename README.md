# SmartCredit-Risk-Analyzer
This project predicts whether a credit cardholder will default on their next payment using machine learning. The model is trained on historical credit data, including payment history, credit limits, and balance usage. It leverages classification algorithms to assess credit risk and help financial institutions make informed lending decisions.
